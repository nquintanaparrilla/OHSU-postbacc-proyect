# MCF10A Cell Image Analysis Pipeline

## 1. Sorting 
For personal preference, I organized all of the raw images obtained by the IncuCyte using [raw_sort.py](image_analysis/raw_sort.py). This sorted all the raw images into their respective folders following by the well plate's letter, well number and area of vision. For example, all images corresponding to well A, well number 1 and area of vision 1 were sorted into a folder called A1_1, and so on.
